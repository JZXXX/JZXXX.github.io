I am a researcher at [Beijing Institute for General Artificical Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai/).

 I received my Ph.D. degree from [the School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/)  at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/). I am interested in machine learning and natural language processing. In addition, I have a great passion for cognitive science and psychology.

 Recently, our team focuses on NLP applications for embodied AI, infomation extraction and reinforcement learning. Welcom to contract us if you have similar research interests with us.
